# Overview

A simple, but powerfully-configurable way to retry things that may fail.

```go
err := retry.How(&retry.With{Times: 3, WaitFor: 10*time.Seconds}).This( func()error {
	// Retry something!
	return errors.New("boom")
})
if err != nil {
	// log the last error encountered
	log.Error(err.Last())
}


// Re-usable
threeTimes := retry.With{Times: 3, WaitFor: 10*time.Second}

err = retry.How(&threeTimes).This(func()error {
	// Retry something!
	return nil
})
if err == nil {
	log.Println("no errors, hurray!")
}
```

# Why is this so complicated

This module doesn't just implement a very basic Retry system, it also provides and implements a very extensible interface, too. You can build your own retry controllers (With) and your code shouldn't have to change except what you toss into How(). Neat, eh?
