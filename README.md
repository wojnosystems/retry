# Overview

A simple, but powerfully-configurable way to retry things that may fail.

## Linear, max tries-gated

The Retry.MaxAttempts creates a retry service that aborts once so many attempts have occurred. It has a linear time back-off and will wait 10 seconds after each failure in which a retry should follow (it will not trigger a wait state if the function will not perform an additional try).

```go
err := retry.How(&retry.MaxAttempts{
        Times: 3, 
        WaitFor: 10*time.Seconds,
	}.New()).This( func(controller retry.Controller)error {
	// Retry something!
	return errors.New("boom")
})
if err != nil {
	// log the last error encountered
	log.Error(err.Last())
	
	// log all errors using library's default message, which joins all errors together. This is sloppy and not intended for full production use, but it's your party.
	log.Error(err)
	
	// or loop through the slice of errors
	allErrors := err.Errors()
	for i := range allErrors {
		anError := allErrors[i]
		_ = anError // do something with it
	}
}
```

## Re-usable configuration

This allows you to create the configuration once, and re-use it for multiple instances. Calling .New() creates a new counter so that there is no shared state.

```go
// Re-usable
threeTimes := retry.MaxAttempts{
	Times: 3, 
	WaitFor: 10*time.Second,
}

err = retry.How(threeTimes.New()).This(func(controller retry.Controller)error {
	// Retry something!
	return nil
})
if err == nil {
	log.Println("no errors, hurray!")
}
```

## Hard/Fast fail

If you need to stop retrying for whatever reason, just tell controller to Abort.

```go
err = retry.How(threeTimes.New()).This(func(controller retry.Controller)error {
	// Only try once
	controller.Abort()
	return errors.New("just once")
})
if err != nil {
	// Only the "just once" error will appear and it will appear ONLY one time
	log.Error(err.Last())
}
```

## Exponential (Base2)

Linear waits are fine for many applications, but exponential waiting is very common requests for retry architectures.

```go
// Tries at most 7 times, with back-offs:
// 1st error: 10 seconds (total: 10 seconds)
// 2nd error: 20 seconds (total: 30 seconds)
// 3rd error: 40 seconds (total: 70 seconds)
// 4th error: 80 seconds (total: 150 seconds)
// 5th error: 160 seconds (total: 310 seconds)
// 6th error: 200 seconds (total: 510 seconds)
// 7th error: 200 seconds (total: 710 seconds)
// 
base2 := retry.ExpBase2{
	Times: 7, // maximum number of attempts to make, after which an error will be returned
	Scaling: 10*time.Second, // The starting point for our exponential back waits
	MaxAttemptWaitTime: 200*time.Second, // no single attempt may wait longer than 200 seconds after a failure
}
sevenErrorsReturned := retry.How(base2.New()).This(func(controller retry.Controller)error {

	return errors.New("boom!")
})
```

## Exponential With Context

The exponential configuration controls the time waiting for EACH attempt, but if you want to have a global timeout, send in your context configured with a global deadline.

```go
// Tries as many times as needed, but does not exceed 5 minutes
// 1st error: 10 seconds (total: 10 seconds)
// 2nd error: 20 seconds (total: 30 seconds)
// 3rd error: 40 seconds (total: 70 seconds/1.16 minutes)
// 4th error: 80 seconds (total: 150 seconds/2.5 minutes)
// 5th error: never occurs, context causes an abort
withTimeout := retry.ExpBase2{
	Scaling: 10*time.Second,
	// No need for MaxAttemptWaitTime
}
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Minute)
defer cancel()
fourErrorsReturned := retry.How(withTimeout.NewWithContext(ctx)).This(func(controller retry.Controller)error {
	return errors.New("boom")
})
```

# Why is this so complicated

This module doesn't just implement a very basic Retry system, it also provides and implements a very extensible interface, too. You can build your own retry controllers (With) and your code shouldn't have to change except what you toss into How(). Neat, eh?
